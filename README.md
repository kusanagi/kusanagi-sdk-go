**Go** SDK to interface with the **KUSANAGI**™ framework (http://kusanagi.io).

Requirements
------------

* [KUSANAGI framework](http://kusanagi.io) 5.0+
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16+
* [libzmq](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) 4.3.4+

Installation
------------

Install the SDK using the following command:

```
$ go get github.com/kusanagi/kusanagi-sdk-go/v5@epoch-5
```

Getting Started
---------------

See the [getting started](http://kusanagi.io/docs/getting-started) tutorial to begin with the **KUSANAGI**™ framework and the **Go** SDK.

### Cancellation Signal

The Go SDK implements support to signal deadlines or cancellation through a read only channel that is available to **Middleware** and **Service** components.

The channel can be read using the `Api.Done()` method. For example, within a service action:

```go
func handler(action *kusanagi.Action) (*kusanagi.Action, error) {
    // Create a context for the current service call
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

    // Create a channel to get the task result
    result := make(chan int)

    // Run some async task
    go task(ctx, result)

    // Cancel the context when the service call times out
    select{
    case v := <-result:
       action.Log(v, 6)
    case <-action.Done():
        cancel()
    }

    return action, nil
}
```

It is highly recommended to monitor this channel and stop any ongoing task when the channel is closed.
